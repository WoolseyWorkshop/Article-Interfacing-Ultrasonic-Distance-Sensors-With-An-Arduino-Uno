# Interfacing Ultrasonic Distance Sensors With An Arduino Uno Article Resources
This repository contains resources related to the [Interfacing Ultrasonic Distance Sensors With An Arduino Uno](https://www.woolseyworkshop.com/2020/04/10/interfacing-ultrasonic-distance-sensors-with-an-arduino-uno/) article published on [WoolseyWorkshop.com](https://www.woolseyworkshop.com).

## [HCSR04_Simple](HCSR04_Simple)
An Arduino sketch that reads an HC-SR04, or compatible, ultrasonic distance sensor on an Arduino Uno.

## [HCSR04_ClassArray](HCSR04_ClassArray)
An Arduino sketch that reads an array of HC-SR04, or compatible, ultrasonic distance sensors on an Arduino Uno.

This sketch provides the following enhancements over the HCSR04_Simple sketch:
* separates out the distance sensor as a distinct class,
* provides the ability to specify a valid distance range,
* incorporates an array of sensors,
* provides the ability to specify the sensor sampling rate,
* provides distance sensor measurement times for use during testing, and
* adds enhanced functionality.
